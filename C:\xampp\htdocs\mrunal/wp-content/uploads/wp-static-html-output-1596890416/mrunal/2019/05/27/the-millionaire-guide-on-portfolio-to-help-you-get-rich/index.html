           <p>It’s been quite a while since talked about our failures here. Since then, we’ve made some new mistakes but used each of them as an opportunity to grow and we would like to share with you the lessons we learned. In Netguru, we strive to deliver the best work possible, but, we admit, we sometimes fail and, as long as we don’t make the same mistake twice, we accept it as a part of the learning curve.</p>
<p>Today, I’d like to tell you about the popular mistakes a PM can make (and we know because we’ve made them all) so that you can avoid them in your daily work.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-23 size-full" src="https://chawdamrunal.github.io/mrusite/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lg-image.png" alt="" width="920" height="500" srcset="https://chawdamrunal.github.io/mrusite/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lg-image.png 920w,https://chawdamrunal.github.io/mrusite/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lg-image-300x163.png 300w,https://chawdamrunal.github.io/mrusite/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lg-image-768x417.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-23" class="wp-caption-text">New features will help keep your data on your device</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is actually one of the misconceptions we try to warn our PM’s about from the very beginning of their time in Netguru. The fact that we work in the Time and Material model and iterations that in most cases cost the same amount of money and we meet at regular Sprint Reviews with Clients doesn’t mean that we can skip tracking budget altogether.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>You don’t need to track budget in SCRUM</h3>
<p>As a Project Manager, one of our core responsibilities is to help the Client understand not only the progress we’re making in the project but also the amount of money that has been spent and the money that still needs to be invested to deliver features that will bring value to our users. This knowledge enables the Client to calculate the ROI on specific features or iterations and plays a key role in supporting the Client with strategic decisions about the product.</p>
<p>This mistake is quite tricky and it’s an easy pitfall to fall into. It is true that we work with our Product Owners (aka Clients) who ultimately have the final say regarding the scope of the product and priorities we follow. On the other hand, we need to remember that we have a unique perspective on the product, which helps to detect the blind spots in the Client’s vision and consult the Client on the future direction of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I’m not a PO, I don’t need to know the product that well</h3>
<p>In our projects, we work with great Product Owners, making sure their vision is accurately translated into reality. While focusing on productivity and removing the impediments with the team, it is sometimes easy to get lost in the features we implemented, how they actually fit in the product, and whether they meet the user’s needs. But it’s crucial for us to know the market and product well to be able to advise our clients in choosing the most valuable features to work on and help teams work as efficiently as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Technology powering game development has only gotten better, yet crunch time has only gotten worse.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But there are times when we assume that since something was said once, everybody remembers it, and we don’t really need to communicate it again, which most likely is a mistake. In a PM’s work, there is no such thing as over-communication. You need to make sure that all information is clear and delivered on time even if it means summarizing every discussion in writing and making sure that their outcomes and next steps are clear to everyone. It creates trust between partners and prevents some unfortunate assumptions and expectations.</p>

<p>Communication with our Clients and teams is one of the most important responsibilities of a Project Manager as well as one of the activities we use most often in our daily work. Hence, we keep our communication transparent, to the point, and as clear as possible so that all parties can get on the same page quickly.</p>
