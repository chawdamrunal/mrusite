There are times when we assume that since something was said once, everybody remembers it, and we don’t really need to communicate it again, which most likely is a mistake. In a PM’s work, there is no such thing as over-communication. You need to make sure that all information is clear and delivered on time even if it means summarizing every discussion in writing and making sure that their outcomes and next steps are clear to everyone. It creates trust between partners and prevents some unfortunate assumptions and expectations.]]></description>
